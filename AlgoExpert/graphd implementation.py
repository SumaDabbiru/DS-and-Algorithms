Algorithm:
    
Created a stack of nodes and visited array.
Insert the root in the stack.
Run a loop till the stack is not empty.
Pop the element from the stack and print the element.
For every adjacent and unvsisted node of current node, mark the node and insert it in the stack.
Implementation of Iterative DFS: This is similar to BFS, the only difference is queue is replaced by stack.
